    Focus is a communication app with a minimalistic design that allows for
    simple communication with friend through a friend code. Focus allowed me to
    explore Socket.io and working with real time communication. I also got to
    sharpen my React skills. When an account is created a uuid is also
    generated, that uuid acts like a phone number to create contacts and
    conversations with friends.
